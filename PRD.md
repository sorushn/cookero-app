## Overview

Cookero is an app that allows for collecting recipes, planning meals, and creating shopping lists.

### Problem Statement

### Solution Statement

I will create a web app that allows users to create, edit, and share recipes, plan meals, and create shopping lists.

## Product Goals

Initial plan is self-use through a web browser. Future plans include mobile app and desktop app.

### User Stories

2. As a user, I want to be able to edit a recipe. I should be able to update the name, ingredients, and instructions.
3. As a user, I want to be able to delete a recipe.
4. As a user, I want to be able to view the ingredients for a recipe.
